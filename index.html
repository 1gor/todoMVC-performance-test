          The goal of this performance comparison was to see if FiberJS has issues, memory leaks or is too slow to play with 
          the "adults". As it turns out its small size and straighforward rendering makes it more than competitive on speed.
          I recommend running the tests on multiple browsers as they show different results.
      </p>
      <p>
          You can see how smaller frameworks outperform React and Angular especially with
          100+ items. Actually around 1000 and 2000 items they blow up and become
          painfully slow - this why I set the max as 500 items for now.
      </p>
      <p>
          Mercury and Alkali are pretty fast on Chrome. On Firefox and Safari Dom rendering is faster but JS engine is slower,
          so it shows different results - FiberJS is outperforming all others up until 3-400 items. After that the advantage of
          "debouncing" DOM rendering efforts works in the favor of Virtual Dom solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
          I would love to see a hybrid solution in place which uses Event Driven Architecture but leverages the power of
          Virtual DOM and smart "debounced" rendering. So will try to make that happen at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
          Note: Still need to get fresher versions of both Angular2 and React. The Angular2
          test is using 2.0 and the React + Redux test is using React 15.5.
      </p>
      <p>
          Will try to get a React version which is not using Redux as it seems that slows the process down significantly...
